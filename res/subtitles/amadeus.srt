1
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,880
Mozart!

2
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,760
Mozart!

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,880
Forgive your assassin!

4
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,000
I confess,I killed you!

5
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,560
"S?,I killed you,Mozart.

6
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,200
Mozart,"piet?! Forgive your assassin!

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,680
Forgive me,Mozart!

8
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,440
Signore Salieri, open the door,be good now!

9
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,880
"Signore",we have something special for you.

10
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,480
Something you're going to love.

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,600
Is that good!

12
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,000
"Signore",believe me...

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,280
...this is the most delicious thing I ever ate in my life!

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,280
Really,you don't know what you're miss...

15
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,280
All right,that's enough! Open the door.

16
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,400
"Signore",if you don't open this door...

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,480
...we're gonna leave nothing for you.

18
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,480
And I'm never gonna come see you again!

19
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,760
Good morning,Father.

20
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,200
Herr Salieri?

21
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,640
Leave me alone.

22
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,480
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.

23
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,080
Do you know who I am?

24
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,120
That makes no difference.

25
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,880
All men are equal in God's eyes.

26
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,520
Are they?

27
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,000
Offer me your confession.

28
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,160
I can offer you God's forgiveness.

29
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,400
How well are you trained in music?

30
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,960
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.

31
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,440
- Where? - Here in Vienna.

32
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,600
Then you must know this.

33
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,040
I can't say that I do.

34
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,520
What is it?

35
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,800
It was a very popular tune in its day.

36
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,880
I wrote it.

37
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,280
Here,how about this?

38
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,040
This one brought down the house when we played it.

39
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,000
Well?

40
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,760
I regret it is not too familiar.

41
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,080
Can you recall no melody of mine?

42
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,520
I was the most famous composer in Europe.

43
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,880
I wrote 40 operas alone.

44
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,720
Here!

45
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,920
What about this one?

46
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,800
Yes,I know that!

47
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,560
That's charming!

48
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,360
I'm sorry,I didn't know you wrote that.

49
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,080
I didn't.

50
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,520
That was Mozart.

51
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Wolfgang...

52
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,480
...Amadeus Mozart.

53
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,320
The man you accuse yourself of killing.

54
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,400
You've heard that?

55
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,160
Is it true?

56
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,880
For God's sake,my son...

57
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,440
...if you have something to confess, do it now.

58
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,880
Give yourself some peace.

59
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,240
He...

60
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,840
...was my idol.

61
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Mozart.

62
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,360
I can't think of a time when I didn't know his name.

63
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,360
I was playing games...

64
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,880
... when he was playing music for kings and emperors.

65
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,360
Even the pope in Rome.

66
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,080
I admit,I was jealous...

67
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,520
... when I heard the tales they told about him.

68
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,080
Not of the brilliant little prodigy...

69
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,200
... but of his father, who had taught him everything.

70
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,240
My father,he did not care for music.

71
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,840
When I told him...

72
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,600
...how I wished I could be like Mozart...

73
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,240
... he would say,"Why? Do you want to be a trained monkey?

74
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:08,000
You'd like me to drag you around, doing tricks like a circus freak?"

75
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,480
How could I tell him...

76
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,000
...what music meant to me?

77
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,720
While my father prayed earnestly to God...

78
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,880
... to protect commerce...

79
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,000
... I would offer up...

80
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,680
... secretly...

81
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,120
... the proudest prayer a boy could think of.

82
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,680
"Lord,make me a great composer."

83
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,840
"Let me celebrate your glory through music...

84
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,040
... and be celebrated myself."

85
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,960
"Make me famous through the world."

86
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,440
"Make me immortal."

87
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,600
"After I die...

88
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:12,760
...let people speak my name with love for what I wrote."

89
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,560
"In return...

90
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,200
...I will give you my chastity...

91
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,320
...my industry...

92
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,720
...my deepest humility, every hour of my life."

93
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,160
"Amen."

94
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,960
And do you know what happened?

95
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,840
A miracle!

96
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,440
My life changed forever.

97
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,280
I knew God had arranged it all. That was obvious.

98
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,720
One minute I was a frustrated boy...

99
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,800
...in an obscure little town. The next I was here...

100
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,040
...in Vienna,city of musicians...

101
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,000
... and Emperor Joseph, the musical king.

102
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,200
In a few years,I was his court composer. Isn't that incredible?

103
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,640
Every night I sat with the emperor of Austria...

104
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,680
... playing duets with him...

105
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,120
... correcting the royal sight-reading.

106
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,920
Actually,the man had no ear at all.

107
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,880
But what did it matter?

108
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,960
He adored my music.

109
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,080
Tell me...

110
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,080
If you had been me...

111
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,400
...wouldn't you have thought God had accepted your vow?

112
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,160
And believe me,I honored it.

113
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,880
I was a model of virtue.

114
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,400
I kept my hands off women.

115
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,080
I worked hours every day teaching students,many for free!

116
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,480
Sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians.

117
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,320
Work,that was all my life.

118
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,680
And it was wonderful.

119
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Everybody liked me.

120
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,160
I liked myself.

121
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,760
Until he came.

122
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,440
He came to Vienna to play some of his music...

123
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,320
...at the residence of the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg.

124
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,480
Eagerly,I went there to seek him out.

125
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,680
That night...

126
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,720
... changed my life.

127
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,040
As I wandered through the salon...

128
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,960
... I played a little game with myself.

129
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,600
This man had written his first concerto at the age of 4...

130
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,960
... his first symphony at 7, a full-scale opera at 12!

131
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,000
Did it show?

132
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,800
Is talent like that...

133
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,960
... written on the face?

134
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,360
Which one of them...

135
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,280
... could he be?

136
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,360
Mozart is not here.

137
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,280
- Stop it! - I am.

138
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,880
- Stop it! - I am stopping it.

139
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,160
I am! I'm stopping it. Slowly.

140
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,840
There. You see? I've stopped.

141
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,040
- Now we're going back. - No!

142
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,920
Yes! You don't know where you are.

143
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,000
Here,everything goes backwards.

144
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,440
People walk and dance and sing and even talk backwards.

145
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,640
- That's stupid. - Why? People fart backwards.

146
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,200
Ssa-ym-ssik!

147
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,040
Ssa-ym-ssik!

148
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,600
Yes,you are. You are very sick.

149
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,600
No! Say it backwards,shitwit!

150
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,120
Ssa-ym-ssik.

151
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,280
Ssik,kiss.

152
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,960
Ym,my. Ssa.

153
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,520
Kiss my ass.

154
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,040
Em-yrram!

155
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,960
- I'm not playing! - Say it,it's serious.

156
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,120
It's very serious.

157
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,560
Yrram.

158
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,320
Marry me.

159
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,640
I'm not gonna marry you. You're a fiend.

160
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,800
Uoy-evol-I-tub.

161
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,720
Tub.

162
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,360
But I...

163
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,520
...love...

164
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,800
But I love you?

165
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,920
- Tihs-ym-tae. - What?

166
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,720
- Eat. - Eat.

167
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,920
- Ym,my. - My.

168
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,360
Tihs. Eat my shit.

169
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,680
You filthy fiend!

170
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,400
You filthy...!

171
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,400
My music.

172
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,640
They've started without me.

173
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,800
That was Mozart!

174
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:19,040
That giggling,dirty creature I'd just seen crawling on the floor.

175
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,680
- I think that went well,don't you? - Indeed.

176
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,360
The Viennese know good music, don't you think?

177
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
Certainly.

178
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,520
Your Grace.

179
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,920
Ah,Mozart.

180
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,920
- Why? - Why what,sir?

181
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,040
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests...

182
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,600
...by one of my own servants?

183
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,360
The more license I allow you, the more you take.

184
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,960
If His Grace is not satisfied, he can dismiss me.

185
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,720
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg.

186
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,200
- Your father is waiting for you there. - No,Your Grace!

187
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,400
I would prefer you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.

188
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:15,000
I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service...

189
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,480
...and learn your place.

190
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,160
On the page it looked...

191
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,160
Nothing!

192
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,480
The beginning simple,almost comic.

193
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,280
Just a pulse.

194
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,120
Bassoons,basset horns...

195
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,880
...like a rusty squeezebox.

196
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,800
And then,suddenly...

197
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,840
...high above it...

198
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,840
...an oboe.

199
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,280
A single note,hanging there, unwavering.

200
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,760
Until...

201
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,480
...a clarinet took it over...

202
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,320
...sweetened it into a phrase of such delight.

203
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,560
This was no composition by a performing monkey.

204
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,720
This was a music I had never heard.

205
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,480
Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing.

206
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,320
It seemed to me I was hearing the voice of God.

207
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,080
Excuse me.

208
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,120
But why?

209
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,080
Why would God choose an obscene child to be his instrument?

210
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,560
It was not to be believed.

211
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:29,960
This piece had to be an accident. It had to be.

212
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,080
It better be.

213
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,640
How good is he,this Mozart?

214
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,480
He's remarkable,Majesty. I heard an extraordinary opera of his last month.

215
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,640
-Idomeneo,King of Crete.  - That?

216
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,880
A tiresome piece. I heard it too.

217
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,080
Tiresome?

218
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,560
A young man trying to impress beyond his abilities.

219
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Too much spice.

220
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,880
Too many notes.

221
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,360
Majesty...

222
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,080
...it was the most promising work I've heard in years.

223
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,920
Then,we should make some effort to acquire him.

224
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,520
We could use a good German composer in Vienna,surely?

225
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say...

226
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,600
...an opera in German for our National Theater.

227
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,800
Excellent,sire!

228
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,040
But not German. I beg,Your Majesty.

229
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,640
Italian is the proper language for opera.

230
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,120
All educated people agree on that.

231
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,440
What do you think,chamberlain?

232
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,360
In my opinion,it's time we had a piece in our own language.

233
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,240
Plain German for plain people.

234
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,200
Kapellmeister?

235
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,000
Majesty...

236
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,040
...I must agree with "Herr Direttore".

237
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,760
German is...

238
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,680
...too brute for singing.

239
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,600
Court composer...

240
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,640
...what do you think?

241
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,960
I think it's an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna.

242
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,280
It should infuriate the archbishop...

243
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,200
...if that is Your Majesty's intention.

244
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,480
You are "cattivo",court composer.

245
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,520
I want to meet this young man. Arrange a pleasant welcome for him.

246
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,960
Well,there it is!

247
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,240
This is a beautiful wig for you.

248
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,400
It looks so marvelous and I love it.

249
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,440
The other one.

250
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,960
Here is the other one. I think you will love it.

251
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,360
Here's the third one. So? Here we go.

252
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,240
- How do you like it? - They're all so beautiful!

253
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,320
Why don't I have three heads?

254
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,680
This is funny!

255
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,240
Three heads!

256
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,680
Gentlemen.

257
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,440
- Good morning. - Morning,Your Majesty.

258
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,640
What do you have for me today?

259
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,760
- Your Majesty,"Herr Mozart". - Yes,what about him?

260
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,480
He's here.

261
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,120
Well,there it is. Good!

262
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,840
I hope you won't find it improper, but I've written a march in his honor.

263
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,080
What a charming idea,court composer. May I see?

264
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,680
Just a...

265
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,120
Just a trifle,of course.

266
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,720
May I try it?

267
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,280
Let's have some fun.

268
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,440
Delightful,court composer!

269
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,040
May I play it when he comes in?

270
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,000
- You do me too much honor. - Bring in "Herr Mozart".

271
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,880
But slowly.

272
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,280
I need a minute to practice.

273
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,120
Good,continue.

274
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,840
G,Majesty.

275
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,880
Excellent!

276
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,200
Good,Majesty.

277
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,760
Continue. Very good.

278
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,320
Very good,Majesty.

279
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,480
Tempo! Up.

280
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,400
Lightly,then strongly! It's a march,Majesty.

281
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,800
Again.

282
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,760
Bravo,Majesty!

283
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:58,760
Gentlemen,please. A little less enthusiasm,I beg you.

284
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,480
No,please. It's not a holy relic.

285
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,640
You know,we have met before. In this very room.

286
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,200
You don't recall. You were only 6. He was giving a delightful concert!

287
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,040
As he got off the stool,he fell.

288
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,120
My sister Antoinette helped him up. Know what he did?

289
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:31,840
He jumped into her arms and said, "Will you marry me? Yes or no?"

290
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,000
You know all these gentlemen. The Baron Van Swieten.

291
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,960
- I'm a great admirer of yours. - Thank you.

292
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,400
Kapellmeister Bonno.

293
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,080
My pleasure.

294
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,920
The Director of Opera, Count Orsini-Rosenberg.

295
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,920
Sir,yes. The honor is mine, absolutely!

296
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,800
Here is our illustrious court composer...

297
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,200
...Maestro Salieri.

298
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,360
At last,such immense joy!

299
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,560
I know your work well.

300
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,360
You know,I composed some variations on a melody of yours.

301
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,520
- Really? Which one? - "Mio Caro Adone."

302
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,120
I'm flattered.

303
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,440
A funny tune, but it yielded good things.

304
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,520
And now he has returned the compliment.

305
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,320
"Herr Salieri" composed this little march for you.

306
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,800
Really?

307
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,040
Well,there it is.

308
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,600
Down to business. We're going to commission an opera from you.

309
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,760
What do you say?

310
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,880
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?

311
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,320
Sire,if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.

312
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,480
Did we?

313
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,880
I don't think it was really decided, Your Majesty.

314
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,160
- German. Please let it be German. - Why so?

315
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,600
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto.

316
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,360
Have I seen it?

317
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,640
I don't think you have,"Herr Direktor". It's quite new.

318
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,200
- I'll show it to you immediately. - I think you'd better.

319
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,120
Well...

320
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,920
...tell us about it. Tell us the story.

321
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,560
Well,it's quite amusing,Majesty.

322
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:42,080
It's set... The whole thing is set in a...

323
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,600
Yes? Where?

324
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,840
In a harem,Majesty. In a seraglio.

325
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,320
- You mean in Turkey? - Yes,exactly.

326
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,480
Then why especially does it have to be in German?

327
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,080
It doesn't,especially. It could be in Turkish if you really want.

328
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,920
No,my dear fellow,the language is not finally the point.

329
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,720
Do you really think that subject is appropriate for a national theater?

330
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,120
Why not? It's charming.

331
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:28,840
I mean,I won't actually show concubines exposing their...

332
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,480
It's not indecent. It's highly moral,Majesty.

333
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,480
It's full of proper German virtues.

334
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,040
Excuse me,Majesty,but what do you think these could be?

335
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,440
Being a foreigner,I'd love to learn.

336
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,000
Well,tell him,Mozart.

337
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,720
Name us a German virtue.

338
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,880
- Love,sire. - Oh,love!

339
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,240
Of course,in Italy we know nothing about love.

340
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,600
No,I don't think you do.

341
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:07,400
Watching Italian opera, all those male sopranos screeching...

342
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:14,640
...stupid,fat couples rolling their eyes about. That's not love. It's rubbish!

343
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,360
Majesty,you choose the language.

344
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,120
I'll set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch.

345
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,520
Well,there it is. Let it be German.

346
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,480
This is yours.

347
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,400
Keep it. It's already here in my head.

348
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,840
What? On one hearing only?

349
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,880
I think so,sire. Yes.

350
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,040
Show us.

351
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,720
The rest is just the same,isn't it?

352
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,400
That doesn't really work,does it?

353
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,880
Did you try...?

354
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,320
Shouldn't it be a bit more...?

355
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,240
Or this?

356
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,040
This. Yes.

357
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,200
Better? What do you think?

358
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,480
Grazie,Signore.

359
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,360
All I ever wanted was to sing to God.

360
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,360
He gave me that longing...

361
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,760
...and then made me mute. Why?

362
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,760
Tell me that.

363
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,840
If he didn't want me to praise him with music...

364
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,920
...why implant the desire...

365
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,360
...like a lust in my body?

366
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,600
And then deny me the talent?

367
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,960
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson,sir.

368
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,400
Maestro.

369
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,120
Well...?

370
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,200
How do you like it?

371
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,800
It's Turkish.

372
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,600
My hairdresser said everything this year's going to be Turkish.

373
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,200
Does he?

374
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,480
What else did he tell you today?

375
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:45,280
Come,come! Give me some gossip.

376
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,720
Well,I heard you met "Herr Mozart".

377
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,960
News travels fast in Vienna.

378
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,160
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?

379
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,600
- Yes. - Is there a part in it for me?

380
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,520
- No. - How do you know?

381
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,400
- Do you know where it's set,my dear? - Where?

382
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,160
In a harem.

383
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,320
- What's that? - A brothel.

384
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,080
Come.

385
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,480
Let's begin.

386
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,160
- What does he look like? - Mozart?

387
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,720
- You might be disappointed. - Why?

388
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,240
Looks and talent don't always go together,Katerina.

389
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,240
Looks don't concern me,maestro.

390
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,920
Only talent interests a woman of taste.

391
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,040
Shall we continue?

392
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,760
There she was.

393
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,400
I don't know where they met or how.  There she stood!

394
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,960
On stage,for all to see.

395
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,800
Showing off like the greedy songbird she was.

396
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,680
Ten minutes of ghastly scales. Arpeggios!

397
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,560
Whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground.

398
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,920
Understand,I was in love with the girl.

399
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,120
Or at least in lust.

400
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:47,280
And I swear to you, I never laid a finger on her.

401
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,360
All the same,I couldn't bear to think of anyone else touching her.

402
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,040
Least of all,"the creature".

403
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:47,840
Brava,madame! You are an ornament to our stage.

404
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,880
Your Majesty.

405
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,920
Well,"Herr Mozart". A good effort.

406
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,840
Well,decidedly that.

407
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:03,360
An excellent effort! You have shown us something...

408
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,680
...quite new tonight. - It is new.

409
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,480
- It is,isn't it,sire? - Yes,indeed.

410
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:14,080
So then,you liked it? You really liked it,sire?

411
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,280
Well,of course I did! It's very good!

412
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,520
Of course,now and then, just now and then...

413
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,520
...it seemed a touch...

414
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,640
What do you mean,sire?

415
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,640
Well,I mean,occasionally, it seems to have...

416
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,840
How shall one say...?

417
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,400
How shall one say,"direktor"?

418
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,160
- Too many notes,Majesty? - Exactly. Very well put.

419
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,560
- Too many notes. - I don't understand.

420
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,320
There are just as many notes as I required,neither more nor less.

421
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,200
My dear fellow,there are in fact...

422
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,920
...only so many notes the ear can hear in an evening.

423
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:07,320
I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I,court composer?

424
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,480
Yes. On the whole,yes,Majesty.

425
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,240
This is absurd!

426
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,720
Young man,don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious.

427
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,600
It's quality work.

428
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:25,480
And there are simply too many notes. Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.

429
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,560
Which few did you have in mind?

430
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,360
Wolfgang!

431
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,960
Wolfgang,my dear!

432
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,080
- Wolfgang! - Majesty,this is "Frau Weber".

433
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,360
She's my landlady.

434
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:52,520
- Enchanted,madame. - Sire,such an honor!

435
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,800
This is my dear daughter,Constanze.

436
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:03,400
- She's the fiancée of "Herr Mozart". - Really?

437
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:11,000
How charming. Please.

438
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,920
Well...

439
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,000
...when do you marry?

440
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,200
We haven't exactly received my father's consent yet.

441
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,960
Not entirely. Not altogether.

442
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:48,200
- Excuse me,but how old are you? - 26.

443
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,760
My advice is for you to marry this charming young lady...

444
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,280
...and stay with us in Vienna. - You see?

445
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,600
I told him that, but he won't listen to me.

446
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,840
Your Majesty, you give such wonderful...

447
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:10,120
...such royal advice. May I...?

448
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,600
Well,there it is.

449
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:26,240
Wolfie,will you get some water?

450
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,840
Will you get some water,please?

451
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,440
Wolfie,get some water!

452
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,720
Excuse me. Excuse me.

453
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,600
Did you know?

454
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,680
- What? - The marriage.

455
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,320
What does it matter to you?

456
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:12,920
Nothing. He can marry who he pleases, I don't give a damn.

457
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,800
How was I?

458
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,160
You were sublime.

459
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,320
And what did you think of the music?

460
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,560
Extremely clever.

461
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,840
Katerina,I...

462
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,240
Excuse me.

463
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,000
Is that woman still lying on the floor?

464
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:41,200
- No,she's fine. - Oh,I'm so relieved.

465
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,920
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.

466
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,240
- Did you like it then? - How could I not?

467
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,040
It's the best music in Vienna today,don't you agree?

468
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:58,000
She must be dazzling in bed.

469
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,120
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department.

470
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:07,800
No other reason why you'd marry someone like that.

471
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,800
Come in.

472
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,840
Excuse me. Wolfie,Mom isn't feeling very well.

473
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,720
- Can we go home? - Yes.

474
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,160
No,no,no. You can't take him away now.

475
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,120
This is his night.

476
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,920
Won't you introduce us,Wolfgang?

477
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:32,400
Excuse us,"Fräulein". Good night,"signore".

478
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,480
At that moment I knew, beyond any doubt...

479
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,760
... he'd had her.

480
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,120
The creature had had my darling girl.

481
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,160
It was incomprehensible!

482
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,160
What was God up to?

483
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,400
Was it possible I was being tested?

484
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,200
Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness...

485
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,240
...in the face of every offense?

486
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,840
No matter how painful?

487
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,760
It's very possible.

488
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,840
But why him?

489
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:25,960
Why choose Mozart to teach me lessons in humility?

490
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,960
My heart was filling up...

491
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:32,880
...with such hatred for that little man.

492
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,520
For the first time in my life, I began to know...

493
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,920
...really...

494
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,200
...violent thoughts.

495
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:48,600
Every day,sometimes for hours, I would pray.

496
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,320
Lord...

497
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,960
...please...

498
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,960
...send him away...

499
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,520
...back to Salzburg.

500
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,640
For his sake...

501
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,960
...as well as mine.

502
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,360
- No! I won't have him back. - But,Your Grace...

503
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:19,120
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled,conceited brat!

504
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,920
Yes,sir...

505
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,520
...that is the truth.

506
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:30,760
But don't blame him. The fault is mine,entirely.

507
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,360
I was too indulgent with him.

508
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,000
Please,Your Grace?

509
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,440
Give him one more chance?

510
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,160
You have leave to try.

511
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,520
God bless,Your Grace! I thank Your Grace.

512
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,280
I thank you!

513
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,800
I write to you with urgent news.  I'm coming to Vienna.

514
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,880
Take no further steps towards marriage until we meet.

515
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:07,200
As you honor the father who has devoted his life to yours...

516
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,920
... do as I bid,and await my coming.

517
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:28,520
I now join you in the holy bonds of matrimony.

518
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,520
Those whom God hath joined together...

519
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,360
...let no man put asunder.

520
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,720
Beloved father:

521
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:55,440
You say Vienna is the musicians' city.  To conquer here is to conquer Europe.

522
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,440
With my wife I can do it.  One day,when I'm wealthy...

523
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,680
... you'll live with us, and we'll be so happy.

524
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,360
Good morning. This is my niece,Princess Elizabeth.

525
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,840
Your Highness.

526
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,360
She's asked me to recommend a music instructor.

527
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,320
- I've come up with an excellent idea. - Your Majesty!

528
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,480
It would be such a tremendous honor!

529
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:35,240
I was thinking of "Herr Mozart". What is your view?

530
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,800
It's an interesting idea, Majesty,but...

531
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,880
Yes?

532
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,520
My concern is to protect you...

533
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:51,200
...from any hint of favoritism.

534
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,680
Favoritism.

535
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,520
- What is this? - What is what?

536
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:04,600
Why must I submit samples of my work to a committee to teach a girl?

537
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:08,400
Because His Majesty wishes it.

538
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,000
Is the emperor angry with me?

539
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,640
- Quite the contrary. - Then why not appoint me to the post?

540
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,040
You are not the only composer in Vienna.

541
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,280
No. But I'm the best.

542
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,440
Mozart.

543
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:31,840
A little modesty might suit you better.

544
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,600
Who is on this committee?

545
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,440
Kapellmeister Bonno,Count Orsini-Rosenberg and Salieri.

546
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,440
Naturally,the Italians! Of course,always the Italians!

547
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,920
They're all musical idiots!

548
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:58,640
- And you want them to judge my music? - Young man...

549
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,840
...the issue is quite simple. If you want this position...

550
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,480
...you must submit your stuff, along with all your colleagues.

551
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,840
Must I?

552
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,800
Well,I won't.

553
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,120
How are we supposed to live?

554
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,960
Do you want me to beg on the streets?

555
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,760
Don't be stupid.

556
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
- All they want to see is your work. - Shit.

557
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:31,120
- What's wrong with that? - Shut up! Just shut up.

558
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,640
One royal pupil, and all of Vienna will come flocking.

559
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,400
They'll come anyway.

560
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,240
- No,they won't. - They love me here.

561
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:48,800
- I know how things work in this city. - You know everything,don't you?

562
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,440
- Yes? - Excuse me,sir.

563
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,600
- A lady insists on talking to you. - Who?

564
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:25,920
She didn't say, but she says it's urgent.

565
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:30,320
Excuse me,my dear.

566
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,840
Your Excellency.

567
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,640
How can I help you?

568
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:48,120
- Frau Mozart? - I've come on behalf of my husband.

569
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:55,520
I brought samples of his work so he can be considered for the appointment.

570
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:01,280
How charming, but why did he not come himself?

571
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,840
Well,he's terribly busy,sir.

572
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,680
I understand.

573
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,800
I will look at them the moment I can.

574
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:19,400
It will be an honor. Please give him my warmest regards.

575
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:24,080
Would it be too much trouble to ask you to look at them now?

576
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,960
- While I wait. - I'm afraid I'm not at leisure...

577
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,720
...this precise moment.

578
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,600
Leave them with me. I assure you,they will be safe.

579
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,320
I really cannot do that,sir.

580
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:44,600
You see,he doesn't know I'm here.

581
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,160
Then he didn't send you?

582
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,640
No,sir. This was my own idea.

583
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,880
- I see. - Sir,we're desperate.

584
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,200
We really need this job.

585
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,000
My husband spends far more than he can ever earn.

586
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,920
I don't mean that he's lazy,because he works all day long.

587
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,720
It's just that he's not practical.

588
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:19,600
Money simply slips through his fingers. It's ridiculous.

589
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,880
Let me offer you some refreshment.

590
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:28,000
Do you know what these are?

591
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:32,320
"Capezzoli di Venere"! Nipples of Venus.

592
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,520
They're Roman chestnuts in brandied sugar. Try one. Go on,try one!

593
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,840
They're quite surprising.

594
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,640
They're wonderful!

595
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,000
Thank you very much,Your Excellency.

596
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,480
Don't keep calling me that.

597
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,880
Keeps me at such a distance.

598
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,240
I wasn't born a court composer,you know.

599
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,560
I'm from a small town.

600
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,480
Just like your husband.

601
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,240
Are you sure you can't...

602
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:17,080
...leave this and come back again?

603
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,200
It's very tempting,sir.

604
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,920
But it's impossible,I'm afraid.

605
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,320
He'd be frantic if he knew they were missing.

606
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:31,040
You see,they're all originals.

607
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:36,240
- Originals? - Yes,sir. He doesn't make copies.

608
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,160
These...

609
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,400
...are originals?

610
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,120
Astounding!

611
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:32,360
It was actually... It was beyond belief.

612
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,640
These were first and only...

613
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,040
... drafts of music.

614
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:46,440
But they showed no corrections of any kind. Not one.

615
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,960
He had simply written down music...

616
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,240
...already finished in his head.

617
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:01,520
Page after page of it. As if he were just taking dictation.

618
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,920
And music...

619
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:14,480
...finished as no music is ever finished.

620
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,840
Displace one note...

621
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,760
...and there would be diminishment.

622
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,800
Displace one phrase,and the structure would fall.

623
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,760
It was clear to me...

624
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,960
... that sound I had heard in the archbishop's palace...

625
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,760
... had been no accident.

626
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,560
Here again was the very voice of God.

627
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,880
I was staring through the cage...

628
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:58,880
...of those meticulous ink strokes...

629
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:04,680
...at an absolute beauty.

630
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:22,480
Is it not good?

631
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:28,640
It is miraculous.

632
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:37,080
Yes,he's very proud of his work.

633
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,680
So you will help us?

634
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,200
I dine with the emperor tomorrow evening.

635
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,880
One word from me and the post is his.

636
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:52,160
Thank you,Your Excellency! Thank you!

637
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,800
Come back tonight.

638
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,960
- Tonight? - Alone.

639
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,800
What for?

640
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:09,200
Some service deserves service in return.

641
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,200
No?

642
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,840
- What do you mean? - Isn't it obvious?

643
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,320
It's a post all Vienna seeks.

644
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,800
If you wish it for your husband,come tonight.

645
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,720
I'm a married woman,sir.

646
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,920
Then don't.

647
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,480
It's up to you.

648
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:37,520
And not to be vague,that is the price.

649
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:53,000
There is no God of mercy,Father.

650
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:58,200
Just a God of torture.

651
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,720
Evening came.

652
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:11,000
I sat there,not knowing whether she would return or not.

653
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:16,880
I prayed as I had never prayed before.

654
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,360
Dear God...

655
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,920
... enter me now.

656
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,760
Fill me with one piece of true music.

657
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,360
One piece with your breath in it,so I know that you love me.

658
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:39,040
Show me one sign of your favor,and I will show mine to Mozart.

659
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,400
I will get him the royal position.

660
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,440
Enter me.

661
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,760
Please.

662
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,720
Please!

663
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,640
Yes?

664
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:07,640
That lady is back,sir.

665
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,320
Show her in.

666
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:48,360
Well?

667
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,040
I'm here.

668
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:57,960
My husband has gone to a concert.

669
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:02,720
He didn't think I would enjoy it.

670
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,680
Well,where shall we go?

671
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,240
Should we stay here?

672
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,440
Well...

673
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,800
Do you still want to look at these?

674
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:35,880
Or don't we need to bother anymore?

675
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:40,640
Suppose we don't,really.

676
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:39,760
Show this woman out.

677
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,840
Stanzi.

678
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,360
Stanzi.

679
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,120
What is it?

680
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:18,480
What's the matter? Tell me.

681
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,680
Tell me.

682
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,440
I love you.

683
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,960
I love you.

684
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:37,880
From now on,we are enemies.

685
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,720
You and I.

686
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,760
Because you choose for your instrument...

687
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,880
... a boastful,lustful,smutty,infantile boy...

688
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:54,400
... and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the incarnation.

689
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,760
Because you are unjust...

690
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,480
... unfair...

691
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,840
... unkind...

692
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,840
... I will block you.

693
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,440
I swear it.

694
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:11,160
I will hinder and harm your creature on earth...

695
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,840
... as far as I am able.

696
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,600
I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.

697
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,320
Of course not.

698
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,440
I have to tell you.

699
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:27,920
Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.

700
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,000
Really?

701
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:34,240
One of my own pupils,a very young singer...

702
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,520
...Maria Theresa Paradis...

703
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,520
...told me she was...

704
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,280
Well...

705
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,440
Well,what?

706
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:50,080
Molested,Majesty.

707
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:55,200
Twice,in the course of the same lesson.

708
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:04,240
There is a "Herr Mozart" waiting for you in the salon.

709
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,760
- Whom did they choose? - Herr Zummer.

710
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Herr Zummer?

711
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,880
But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.

712
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:22,560
No,no. He has yet to achieve mediocrity.

713
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,160
I can't lose this post. I simply can't.

714
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,400
Excellency,please.

715
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,600
Let's go to the palace. You can talk to the emperor...

716
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:38,960
...and tell him that "Herr Zummer" is an awful choice.

717
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,240
He could do musical harm to the princess.

718
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:49,440
Between us,no one in the world could do musical harm to the princess.

719
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,480
Look...

720
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,520
...I must have pupils.

721
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,880
Without pupils,I can't manage.

722
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,560
You don't mean you're living in poverty?

723
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,080
No,but I'm broke.

724
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,400
Well,how is this possible?

725
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,720
I hear your concerts are quite successful.

726
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,960
They're stupendously successful.

727
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:18,920
You can't get a seat. But no one will hire me.

728
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,920
They want to hear me play...

729
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:27,480
...but they won't let me teach their daughters,as if I was a fiend.

730
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,160
Seriously...

731
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:37,240
...is there any chance you could manage a loan?

732
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:41,680
Only for six months. Eight,at the most.

733
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,160
You expect your fortunes to change in six or eight months?

734
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,680
As a matter of fact,I do.

735
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:55,200
I am working on something that will explode like a bomb all over Europe.

736
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:00,680
I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything.

737
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,880
You name the terms.

738
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,360
Well,how exciting.

739
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,400
Tell me more.

740
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,520
- It's a bit of a secret. - Come,come. I'm interested.

741
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,000
This is delicious. What is it?

742
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:20,120
It's cream cheese mixed with sugar...

743
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:24,720
...suffused with rum. Crema Mascarpone Speciale.

744
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,520
Italian.

745
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:31,240
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.

746
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,280
Two thou...

747
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:38,560
Two hundred florins. That's all I need.

748
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:42,160
A hundred.

749
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,000
Fifty.

750
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:50,080
What exactly are you working on?

751
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,840
Really,I can't say.

752
01:12:55,080 --> 01:13:02,800
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor,Mozart.

753
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,840
However...

754
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:14,200
...I know a distinguished gentleman I can recommend,and...

755
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,320
...he has a daughter.

756
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,240
Quiet! Quiet!

757
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,520
Herr Mozart.

758
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,440
Welcome. Pay no attention,they're impossible.

759
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:33,480
I treat them just like my own children.

760
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:38,280
Which of them do you wish me to teach?

761
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,760
That's funny.

762
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,760
You're a funny fellow.

763
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,480
This is the instrument. I hope it's to your satisfaction.

764
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:53,720
Of course it'll be to his satisfaction.

765
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:58,280
Come,we're going to listen to some music. Come!

766
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:02,040
Good boy.

767
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,600
Now.

768
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,760
Please play me something,just to give me an idea.

769
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,320
Anything will do.

770
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,840
Just go ahead.

771
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,040
Just as if we weren't here.

772
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:27,200
Part of music,getting used to an audience. Right,"Herr Mozart"?

773
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,960
Perhaps it would be better if we were left alone.

774
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,160
We're both a little shy.

775
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,640
Play.

776
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:38,040
- I said play! - Michael,please.

777
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:42,840
Perhaps if I play first,it might encourage the "Fräulein".

778
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:46,960
Why don't you let me try?

779
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:59,080
Stop it! Stop! He always howls when he hears music.

780
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:02,120
We've got to break him of that habit.

781
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:05,800
We've got to break them of their habit!

782
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,520
Play. Please.

783
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:13,600
"Herr Mozart",play. Please,I beg you.

784
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:23,120
That's it. That's it.

785
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,400
Keep playing!

786
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,360
Keep playing! That's it!

787
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:58,480
Mozart,that's wonderful! Wonderful!

788
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:03,560
Next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs,let me know.

789
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:09,000
Goodbye,"Fräulein". Goodbye,madam. Goodbye,sir.

790
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:08,120
Papa?

791
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:13,640
Papa!

792
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,960
Why are you here?

793
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,920
Am I not welcome?

794
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:26,320
Of course,welcome. Papa,welcome! Welcome!

795
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,040
You're very thin. Doesn't your wife feed you?

796
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:55,440
Of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day!

797
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:59,360
- Is she not here? - No,she had to help her mother.

798
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,360
She's like that.

799
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:06,200
Her mother's a very sweet woman,you'll...

800
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:16,280
I didn't know you were home.

801
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:20,600
Stanzi,this is my father.

802
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:26,360
We'll wait. We'll wait.

803
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:31,440
Why don't you get up now,my darling?

804
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:40,640
She's very tired,poor creature. You know me. I'm such a pig.

805
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,320
It's not easy cleaning up after me.

806
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,640
Don't you have a maid?

807
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,560
Oh. No. We could if we wanted...

808
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,360
...but Stanzi insists on doing everything herself.

809
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,400
How is your...

810
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,160
...financial situation?

811
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,080
Couldn't be better.

812
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,360
That's not what I hear.

813
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,520
What do you mean? It's wonderful.

814
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:14,440
Really,it's marvelous! People love me here.

815
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,600
They say you have debts.

816
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,680
Who?

817
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,840
Who says that?

818
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,360
That's a malicious lie!

819
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,160
Do you have pupils?

820
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:30,440
I don't want pupils!

821
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,960
They get in the way.

822
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:37,160
I have to have time for composition.

823
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,280
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.

824
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,840
That one will.

825
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:46,160
What's that?

826
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,120
It's a secret.

827
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,560
Secret? You don't have secrets from me.

828
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:58,200
No! Please! I don't want you to see it. I don't want anyone to see it.

829
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,440
You'll be so proud of me.

830
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:06,760
It'll be the best thing I've ever done. The best thing anyone...

831
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,840
There she is!

832
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:13,240
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Now,Papa,confess it.

833
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:18,680
- Could you want a prettier daughter? - Stop it,Wolfie!

834
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,960
I look dreadful.

835
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,720
Are you...

836
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,120
...expecting?

837
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:31,040
- Yes,I am. - Isn't it marvelous? We're delighted.

838
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,640
- May I offer you some tea? - Who wants tea? Let's go out!

839
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,680
This calls for a feast. You don't want tea,do you?

840
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,160
I know! Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties,don't you?

841
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:49,240
How can you be so boring? Tea!

842
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,840
Come on,Papa. Hurry!

843
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:57,440
Here we go. Good day.

844
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:41,640
Now!

845
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:50,920
I name the penalty! I name the penalty!

846
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,920
And the penalty is...

847
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:59,800
- Give her a good one! - Show us your legs!

848
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:06,440
Come on,come on!

849
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,680
It's just a game,Papa.

850
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:36,120
Thank you.

851
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:05,040
"Herr Mozart",why don't you name your son's penalty?!

852
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,960
Yes,Papa. Name it.

853
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:14,640
Name it. I'll do anything you say. Anything.

854
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:18,720
I want you to come back to Salzburg with me.

855
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,480
The penalty must be performed in the room.

856
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,840
I'm tired of this game.

857
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:31,160
But my penalty! I've got to have a penalty!

858
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:37,920
I name a penalty!

859
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:40,920
The penalty is...

860
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,360
...you shall play our tune...

861
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:49,760
...in the manner of Johann Sebastian Bach!

862
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:19,600
- Turn him over! - Over?!

863
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,320
Now you play it backwards!

864
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:54,640
- Another one! Give me another one! - Play it like Gluck!

865
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,600
- Boring. Another! - Handel!

866
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,560
I don't like him! Another one!

867
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,520
Play Salieri.

868
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:07,560
Now that is a challenge! That is a challenge.

869
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:12,120
Please! Please!

870
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:49,520
Go on. Mock me. Laugh!

871
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:55,760
That was not Mozart laughing,Father.

872
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,600
That was God.

873
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:04,080
That was God laughing at me through that obscene giggle.

874
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:08,240
Go on,"Signore". Laugh.

875
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:13,840
Show my mediocrity for all to see.

876
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:18,520
One day I will laugh at you.

877
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,920
Before I leave this earth...

878
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:27,520
...I will laugh at you.

879
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:51,200
- Wolfie? - What?

880
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,320
There's a young girl here to see you.

881
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,040
What does she want?

882
01:26:56,280 --> 01:27:02,000
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.

883
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:05,280
Damn.

884
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:11,520
Yes?

885
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,320
- Are you "Herr Mozart"? - That's right.

886
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:20,360
My name is Lorl,sir. I'm a maidservant.

887
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:24,520
I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.

888
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:29,920
They'll be paid for by an admirer of yours who wishes to remain...

889
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,520
...anonymous.

890
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,360
Is this your idea,Papa?

891
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:37,840
Mine?

892
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:43,080
- Are you playing a trick on me? - I've never seen this girl.

893
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:46,920
- Is this some kind of joke? - Not at all,sir.

894
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:49,520
Young woman,this won't do.

895
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,320
My son can't accept such an offer,no matter how generous...

896
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:59,000
...unless he knows who's behind it. - I can't tell you that,sir.

897
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,720
- This is ridiculous! - What is ridiculous?

898
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,640
Wolfie has many admirers in Vienna.

899
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,920
People send us gifts all the time.

900
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:11,880
You cannot accept her without references.

901
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,040
Well,this is none of your business.

902
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:18,000
- Whoever sent you is going to pay? - That's right.

903
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:23,600
Splendid! Now we're going to let a stranger into our house.

904
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:27,560
Who is we? Who is letting who...?

905
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,480
- Could you please wait outside? - Yes,ma'am.

906
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,000
Look,old man!

907
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:39,720
We spend a fortune on you,and all you can do is criticize.

908
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,200
- And now... - Stanzi!

909
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:45,920
No! It's right that he should hear! I'm sick to death of it.

910
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:49,600
We can't do anything right for you,can we?

911
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:53,640
You won't have to do anything for me ever again.

912
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,520
I'm leaving.

913
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,880
- No,Papa. - I won't stay and be a burden.

914
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,000
No one calls you that.

915
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:04,680
She does. She says I sleep all day.

916
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,800
And so you do!

917
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:11,160
The only time you come out is to eat.

918
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:15,240
Well,what do you expect?

919
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:20,680
Do you expect anyone to walk out into a mess like this every day?

920
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:25,680
- So now I'm a bad housekeeper! - So you are. It's a pigsty.

921
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,120
When can you start?

922
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:32,120
- Right away,ma'am. - Good.

923
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:03,240
They're out every night,sir.

924
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,440
Thank you,sir.

925
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:11,400
Do any pupils come to the house?

926
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,880
Not that I've seen.

927
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:17,680
Then how does he pay for all this?

928
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,240
Does he work at all?

929
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:26,360
Yes,sir. All day long. He never leaves the house till evening.

930
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,600
He just sits there,writing and writing.

931
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:32,760
Really?

932
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,840
What is it he's writing?

933
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:40,800
I wouldn't know that,sir.

934
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,800
Of course not.

935
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,000
You're a good girl.

936
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,640
You're very kind to do this.

937
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:54,080
The next time you're sure they'll be out of the house,let me know.

938
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:03,480
Thank you,sir.

939
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:45,120
I think I found out about the money,sir.

940
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,880
Yes? What?

941
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:53,360
He kept seven snuffboxes in here. I could swear they were all gold.

942
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,600
And now look.

943
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,800
There's only one left.

944
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:02,720
Where does he work?

945
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,760
In there,sir.

946
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:54,280
Gentlemen,I've just heard some news...

947
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:57,520
...that may interest you. - What?

948
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:02,400
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.

949
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:05,320
Italian?

950
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:10,200
That's not all. He has chosen for his subject,Figaro.

951
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:13,200
The Marriage of Figaro.

952
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:17,200
He's setting that play to music?

953
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,680
Yes.

954
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:23,360
What is this "Marriage of Figaro"?

955
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:27,040
It's a French play,Kapellmeister.

956
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:30,440
It has been banned by the emperor.

957
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:34,280
You're absolutely sure?

958
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:39,360
Herr Mozart.

959
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,280
Gentlemen,sit down.

960
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:49,200
Mozart.

961
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:53,680
Are you aware that I have declared the French play "Figaro"...

962
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:57,720
...unsuitable for our theater?

963
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,720
Yes,sire.

964
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:06,680
Yet we hear you're making an opera from it. Is this true?

965
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,960
Who told you this,Majesty?

966
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:15,840
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?

967
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,240
Yes,I...

968
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:22,320
I admit it is.

969
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,960
Would you tell me why?

970
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,880
Majesty,it is only a comedy.

971
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:32,880
What you think is scarcely the point.

972
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:36,960
It's what His Majesty thinks that counts.

973
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,240
But,Your Majesty...

974
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:41,320
Mozart...

975
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,720
...I am a tolerant man.

976
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:49,520
I do not censor things lightly. When I do,I have good reason.

977
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:53,160
"Figaro" is a bad play.

978
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:56,080
It stirs up hatred between classes.

979
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:59,320
In France,it has caused only bitterness.

980
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:04,880
My sister Antoinette is beginning to be frightened of her own people.

981
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:08,680
I swear,there's nothing like that in the piece.

982
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:13,800
I've taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.

983
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,560
I'm afraid you're rather innocent.

984
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:21,880
In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our people...

985
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:24,440
...simply over a theater piece.

986
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:29,680
Majesty,this is just a frolic. A piece about love.

987
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,080
"Love". Again!

988
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,960
And it's new!

989
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:38,200
It's entirely new. The people will go mad for it.

990
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:41,200
I have scenes...

991
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,920
The end of Act Il,for example.

992
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:48,120
It starts as a duet. A husband and wife quarreling.

993
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:53,480
Suddenly,the scheming maid comes in. It's a very funny situation.

994
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,520
Duet turns into trio.

995
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,600
Then the husband's valet comes in.

996
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,600
Trio turns into quartet.

997
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:03,760
Then a gardener. Quartet becomes quintet.

998
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,960
And so on,on and on.

999
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:08,760
Sextet,septet,octet.

1000
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,320
How long do you think I can sustain that?

1001
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:15,000
I have no idea.

1002
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,320
Guess.

1003
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,000
Guess,Your Majesty.

1004
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:24,840
Imagine the longest time it could be sustained,then double it.

1005
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,480
Well...

1006
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,280
Six...

1007
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:34,320
...seven minutes?

1008
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:39,880
- Eight minutes? - Twenty,sire. Twenty minutes!

1009
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:44,680
Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives!

1010
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:47,280
Sire,only opera can do this.

1011
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:51,400
In a play,if more than one person speaks at once...

1012
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:53,560
...it's just noise.

1013
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:56,320
But with opera,with music...

1014
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:00,680
...you can have 20 individuals all talking at the same time.

1015
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,120
It's not noise. It's a perfect harmony!

1016
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:07,440
Mozart,music is not the issue here.

1017
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:12,960
No one doubts your talent. It's your literary judgment that's in question.

1018
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:19,200
Even with the politics taken out,it would still remain a vulgar farce.

1019
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:22,240
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?

1020
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:26,520
Surely you can choose more elevated themes.

1021
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:29,880
Elevated! What does that mean,elevated?

1022
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:33,840
I am fed to the teeth with these...

1023
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:37,320
...elevated things. Old dead legends.

1024
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:41,640
Why must we go on forever writing of gods and legends?

1025
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:44,160
Because they do.

1026
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,400
They go on forever.

1027
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:51,560
At least what they represent: the eternal in us.

1028
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,560
Opera is here to ennoble us,Mozart.

1029
01:38:54,800 --> 01:39:00,880
You and me,just the same as His Majesty.

1030
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:06,880
"Bello,bello,bello." Come on now,be honest!

1031
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:12,760
You'd rather listen to your hairdresser than Hercules,Horatius or Orpheus.

1032
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,600
People so lofty,they sound as if they shit marble!

1033
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,680
What!

1034
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:25,520
Govern your tongue,Mozart! How dare you!

1035
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:32,240
Forgive me,Majesty.

1036
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,880
I'm a vulgar man...

1037
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:39,880
...but I assure you,my music is not.

1038
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:45,120
You are passionate,Mozart...

1039
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:50,880
...but you do not persuade.

1040
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:55,680
Sire,the whole opera is finished.

1041
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,240
Do you know how much work went into it?

1042
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:05,720
His Majesty has been more than patient,"Signore".

1043
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,200
How can I persuade if I can't show it?

1044
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:14,040
That will do,"Herr Mozart".

1045
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:17,200
Just let me tell you how it begins.

1046
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:22,880
May I just do that,Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?

1047
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:28,960
Please.

1048
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:31,040
Look...

1049
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:34,720
There's a servant on his knees. Do you know why?

1050
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:38,360
Not from oppression. He's measuring a space.

1051
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,600
Do you know what for?

1052
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:43,520
His bed. His wedding bed.

1053
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:47,600
To see if it will fit!

1054
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:57,880
Late.

1055
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:00,040
Late!

1056
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:01,880
On the beat.

1057
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:05,320
Good!

1058
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:09,040
Yes!

1059
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:17,200
Early!

1060
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:25,200
Well,Mozart is already rehearsing.

1061
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:33,520
In that case,gentlemen,I think...

1062
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:40,840
I think we should help Mozart all we can.

1063
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:45,760
And protect him against the emperor's anger.

1064
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,840
What anger?

1065
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:50,800
About the ballet.

1066
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:53,600
What ballet?

1067
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,000
Excuse me...

1068
01:41:56,280 --> 01:42:03,040
...but didn't His Majesty specifically forbid the ballet in his opera?

1069
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,840
- Herr Mozart! - Yes?

1070
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:44,200
- A word with you. - Certainly,"Herr Direktor".

1071
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:47,040
Now,"Herr Mozart"!

1072
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:49,080
Five minutes,please.

1073
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:52,240
Five minutes!

1074
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,520
Yes?

1075
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:59,480
Do you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in operas?

1076
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:04,640
- It's not a ballet,it's a dance. - Exactly. A dance.

1077
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:09,520
Surely,His Majesty didn't mean no dancing when it's in the story.

1078
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:16,760
It's dangerous to interpret his edicts. Give me your score,please.

1079
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:27,360
Thank you.

1080
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,960
What are you doing,"Herr Direktor"?

1081
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:36,680
Taking out what you should never have put in.

1082
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,800
Please. Please!

1083
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:42,440
I have no one else to turn to.

1084
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:45,320
- What is it? - It's unbelievable.

1085
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:49,720
The "direktor" has torn up a huge section of my music.

1086
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:53,560
They say I have to rewrite the opera.

1087
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:56,240
But it's perfect as it is.

1088
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:57,720
I can't...

1089
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:02,080
...rewrite what's perfect.

1090
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:03,680
Please.

1091
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,560
Can't you talk to him?

1092
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,040
Please.

1093
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:11,040
Why bother? He's no friend of yours.

1094
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:16,520
I could kill him! I mean,really! Kill him!

1095
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:21,080
I threw the entire score into the fire,he made me so angry.

1096
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:28,160
- You burned the score? - No,my wife took it out in time.

1097
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:31,120
Thank God.

1098
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:37,440
It's unfair that a man like that should have power over our work!

1099
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:42,600
But there are those who have power over him.

1100
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:47,640
I think I'll take this up with the emperor.

1101
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,480
Excellency...

1102
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:52,520
...would you?

1103
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:56,360
With all my heart,Mozart.

1104
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:59,080
Thank you.

1105
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:05,840
Please,"Herr Mozart". "Please,it's not a holy relic."

1106
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:11,200
I don't need to tell you I said nothing,whatever,to the emperor.

1107
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:17,440
I went to the theater to tell Mozart something,anything...

1108
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:22,360
... when suddenly,in the middle of the third act...

1109
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:25,720
... to my astonishment,the emperor...

1110
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:32,120
... who never attended rehearsals,suddenly appeared.

1111
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:52,920
What is this?

1112
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:56,600
I don't understand.

1113
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:59,040
Is it modern?

1114
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:01,000
Majesty...

1115
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:02,920
...the "Herr Direktor"...

1116
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:06,040
...he has removed "un balletto"...

1117
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:11,520
...that would have occurred at this place.

1118
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,280
Why?

1119
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,640
It is your regulation,sire.

1120
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:20,480
No ballet in your opera.

1121
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:27,560
Salieri.

1122
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:31,080
Do you like this?

1123
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:35,720
It's not a question of liking,Majesty.

1124
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:40,560
Your own law decrees it,I'm afraid.

1125
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:44,560
Well,look at them!

1126
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:48,320
No! This is nonsense!

1127
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:52,560
- Let me see the scene with the music. - But,sire!

1128
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,240
Oblige me!

1129
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:58,080
Yes,Majesty.

1130
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:08,840
Can we see the scene with the music,please?

1131
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:13,960
Certainly! Certainly,"Herr Direktor"!

1132
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,280
Bring the palace set back in,please.

1133
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:00,520
The restored third act...

1134
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:03,760
...was bold,brilliant.

1135
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,560
The fourth...

1136
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:11,960
...was astounding.

1137
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:19,880
I saw a woman...

1138
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:25,920
... disguised in her maid's clothes hear her husband speak the first...

1139
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:29,520
... tender words he has offered her in years.

1140
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:34,920
Simply because he thinks she is someone else.

1141
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:40,600
I heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theater...

1142
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:45,840
... conferring on all who sat there,perfect absolution.

1143
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:49,200
God was singing through this little man...

1144
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:52,400
... to all the world.

1145
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:54,560
Unstoppable.

1146
01:48:54,800 --> 01:49:01,760
Making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar.

1147
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:42,720
And then,do you know what happened?

1148
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:47,480
A miracle!

1149
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,560
With that yawn...

1150
01:49:54,840 --> 01:50:00,320
... I saw my defeat turn into a victory.

1151
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:06,320
Mozart was lucky the emperor yawned only once.

1152
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,000
Three yawns...

1153
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:11,240
...and the opera would fail the same night.

1154
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:14,800
Two yawns,within a week at most.

1155
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:21,560
With one yawn,the composer could still get...

1156
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:26,480
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had! Withdrawn!

1157
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:29,040
I know,I know.

1158
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:32,560
It's outrageous.

1159
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:36,480
Still,if the public doesn't like one's work...

1160
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:39,240
...one has to accept the fact gracefully.

1161
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:42,840
But what is it that they don't like?

1162
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:45,400
I can speak for the emperor.

1163
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:48,840
You make too many demands on the royal ear.

1164
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:55,960
The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour. You gave him four.

1165
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:02,520
What did you think of it yourself?

1166
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:06,800
Did you like it at all?

1167
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:09,440
I thought it was marvelous.

1168
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:13,400
Of course. It's the best opera yet written.

1169
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:16,800
I know it!

1170
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:21,400
Why didn't they come?

1171
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:26,360
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese,friend.

1172
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:30,080
You didn't give them a bang at the end of songs...

1173
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:33,280
...to let them know when to clap.

1174
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:35,960
I know,I know.

1175
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:40,480
Maybe you should give me some lessons in that.

1176
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:44,760
I wouldn't presume.

1177
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:49,360
Nevertheless,at the risk of imposing...

1178
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:53,640
...I'd like you to see my new piece.

1179
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,040
It would be an honor for me.

1180
01:51:56,280 --> 01:52:00,480
No,the honor would be all mine.

1181
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:27,920
I believe...

1182
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:29,920
I believe...

1183
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:35,680
...it is the best opera yet written,my friends.

1184
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:39,000
Salieri!

1185
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:43,280
You are the brightest star in the musical firmament.

1186
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:48,560
You do honor to Vienna and to me.

1187
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:15,640
"Herr Mozart"!

1188
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:19,040
- It was good of you to come. - How could I not?

1189
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:22,160
Bravo,maestro.

1190
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:26,440
Did my work please you?

1191
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:31,600
I never knew that music like that was possible.

1192
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:35,240
- You flatter me. - No.

1193
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:37,800
One hears such sounds...

1194
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:43,040
...and what can one say but: Salieri!

1195
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:54,400
Everybody's here and we've got guests. Bravo! Well,I've got some more.

1196
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:58,360
You remember my good friend Schikaneder. Come in.

1197
01:54:58,640 --> 01:54:59,880
Don't be shy.

1198
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:05,080
- This is a very nice girl,and this... - Wolfie?

1199
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,600
Yes,my love?

1200
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:12,440
- These gentlemen are from Salzburg. - Salzburg?

1201
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:17,080
We were just talking about Salzburg.

1202
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:21,920
Your father is dead.

1203
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:45,400
So rose the dreadful ghost...

1204
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:51,520
...from his next and blackest opera.

1205
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:59,600
There on the stage,stood the figure of a dead commander.

1206
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:01,400
I knew...

1207
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:03,360
...only I understood...

1208
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:06,920
...that the horrifying apparition was Leopold...

1209
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:10,360
...raised from the dead!

1210
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:42,440
Wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father...

1211
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:47,520
...to accuse his son before all the world!

1212
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:49,600
It was...

1213
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:54,800
...terrifying and wonderful to watch.

1214
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:00,400
And now...

1215
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:09,000
...the madness began in me.

1216
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:14,800
The madness of a man splitting in half.

1217
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:19,440
Through my influence,I saw to it...

1218
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:23,520
... "Don Giovanni" was played only five times in Vienna.

1219
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:28,360
But,in secret,I went to every one of those five.

1220
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:35,080
Worshiping sound I alone seemed to hear.

1221
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:23,600
And as I stood there,understanding how...

1222
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:27,400
...that bitter old man was still possessing his poor son...

1223
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:30,320
... even from beyond the grave...

1224
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:32,480
... I began to see a way...

1225
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:34,480
... a terrible way...

1226
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:37,640
...I could finally triumph...

1227
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:41,240
...over God.

1228
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:53,000
"Herr Mozart"?

1229
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:58,680
I have come to commission work from you.

1230
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:03,240
- What work? - A Mass for the dead.

1231
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:05,640
What dead?

1232
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:07,920
Who is dead?

1233
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:12,800
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.

1234
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:16,560
- Who are you? - I am only a messenger.

1235
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:19,080
Do you accept?

1236
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:23,280
You will be well paid.

1237
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:33,080
Do you accept?

1238
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:43,560
Work fast.

1239
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:46,520
And be sure tell no one what you do.

1240
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:50,800
You will see me again soon.

1241
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:28,720
Wolfie?

1242
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:41,960
My plan was so simple...

1243
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:46,280
...that it terrified me.

1244
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:52,320
First,I must get the death Mass,and then...

1245
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:57,040
...I must achieve his death.

1246
02:04:57,280 --> 02:04:59,480
What?

1247
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:02,440
His funeral!

1248
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:03,960
Imagine it!

1249
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:07,280
The cathedral,all Vienna sitting there.

1250
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:13,320
His coffin. Mozart's little coffin in the middle.

1251
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:15,680
And then...

1252
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:19,720
...in that silence...

1253
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:23,360
...music.

1254
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:25,840
A divine music...

1255
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:29,400
...bursts out over them all.

1256
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:34,400
A great Mass of death.

1257
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:38,560
Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart.

1258
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:43,240
Composed by his devoted friend...

1259
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:46,960
...Antonio Salieri.

1260
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:48,880
What sublimity!

1261
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:51,680
What depth!

1262
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:55,480
What passion in the music!

1263
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:59,600
Salieri has been touched by God at last...

1264
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:03,680
...and God forced to listen!

1265
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:07,440
Powerless to stop it!

1266
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:12,680
I,for once,in the end,laughing at him!

1267
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:22,840
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing.

1268
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:25,960
How does one do that?

1269
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:29,960
How does one kill a man?

1270
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:32,160
It's one thing...

1271
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:34,760
...to dream about it.

1272
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:39,800
Very different when you...

1273
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:44,520
When you have to do it...

1274
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:49,520
...with your own hands.

1275
02:06:57,480 --> 02:07:01,840
Come in!

1276
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:20,360
I've come to dinner

1277
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:23,360
Dinner! Are you mad? I'm a nobleman!

1278
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:27,000
I only ever dine with people of my own height!

1279
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:29,480
Stop it!

1280
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:31,800
Be careful Be careful

1281
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:35,200
Hold tight

1282
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:37,640
I'm a famous...

1283
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:40,640
... horseman

1284
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:46,760
And we're a famous horsy

1285
02:07:47,240 --> 02:07:51,160
Give me a hoof,my darling

1286
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:56,560
And I'll give you my heart

1287
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:01,280
Take me to your stable

1288
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:06,360
And never more we'll part

1289
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:16,480
Kill me Kill me

1290
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:41,040
We're going to make a soprano stew

1291
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:45,920
We're going to make a soprano stew

1292
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:49,880
And when you make a soprano stew

1293
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:51,960
Shut up!

1294
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:56,480
I'm sick to death of that tune!

1295
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:17,480
Give me some hay,my darling

1296
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:21,200
And I'll give you my heart

1297
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:25,240
Leporello! Some hay!

1298
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:16,600
We hope...

1299
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:22,080
... you're contented

1300
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:24,920
With what...

1301
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:29,920
... we've presented

1302
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:38,360
And love our dove of peace

1303
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:04,720
- What did you think? - It was wonderful!

1304
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:10,120
- He liked the little people. - It's all in good fun.

1305
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:14,160
I liked the horse.

1306
02:11:23,560 --> 02:11:27,400
I tell you,if you played "Don Giovanni" here...

1307
02:11:27,640 --> 02:11:30,560
...you would've had a wonderful success.

1308
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:32,520
You belong here.

1309
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:36,920
Not at the snobby court. You could do anything you like.

1310
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:41,960
The more fantastic,the better. That's what people want: fantasy.

1311
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:45,360
You write a proper part for me...

1312
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:47,880
...a couple of catchy songs...

1313
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:52,880
...I guarantee you a triumph deluxe!

1314
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:58,800
- What do you say? - How much will you pay him?

1315
02:11:59,160 --> 02:12:04,280
Well! I see you brought your manager with you.

1316
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:06,720
Well,madame...

1317
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:10,320
...how about half the receipts?

1318
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:12,080
Half the receipts!

1319
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:14,640
- Stanzi! - I'm talking about now.

1320
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:18,320
How much will you pay him now? Down payment.

1321
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:21,400
Down payment?

1322
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:25,880
Who do you think I am,the emperor?

1323
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:27,640
I have to go.

1324
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:32,560
Stay here,you'll enjoy this next one.

1325
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:33,920
You won't do this.

1326
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:36,480
- Why not? Half the house! - When?

1327
02:12:36,760 --> 02:12:40,760
We need money now! He pays you now,or you don't do it.

1328
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,600
I don't trust that man.

1329
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:46,440
I don't like what he did with your opera. It was common.

1330
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:49,640
You liked it. Monkey,punky,flunky!

1331
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:51,400
Half the house.

1332
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:55,680
You'll never see a penny. I want it here in my hand.

1333
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:59,560
- I'll put it here in your hand. - Shut up!

1334
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:04,760
You won't put a thing in my hand until I see some money!

1335
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:10,040
It's embarrassing. Can't you think of anyone who can do something for him?

1336
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:14,520
I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause,baron.

1337
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:19,000
He has succeeded in alienating practically the whole of Vienna.

1338
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:21,080
He never pays his debts.

1339
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:25,320
I can't think of anyone to whom I'd dare recommend him.

1340
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:30,720
"Herr Mozart". What a surprise!

1341
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:34,360
What can I do for you?

1342
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:40,640
Is my pupil still interested in learning the art of music?

1343
02:13:40,640 --> 02:13:45,800
Your pupil is married and living in Mannheim,young man.

1344
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:49,320
Really?

1345
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:59,120
Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction.

1346
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:01,600
What is it,Mozart?

1347
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:04,520
What's the matter with you?

1348
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:06,240
Well...

1349
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:11,280
...since it appears no one is eager to hire my services...

1350
02:14:11,560 --> 02:14:16,840
...could you favor me with a little money instead?

1351
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:21,320
What for?

1352
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:27,080
If a man cannot earn,he must borrow.

1353
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:32,640
That's hardly the way to go about it.

1354
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:36,240
You are right,sir. You are right.

1355
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:40,920
But you see,I am endowed with talent,and you with money.

1356
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:43,040
If I offer mine...

1357
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:47,520
...you should offer yours.

1358
02:14:49,120 --> 02:14:52,840
I'm sorry,no.

1359
02:14:54,080 --> 02:14:57,320
Please.

1360
02:14:57,640 --> 02:15:01,760
My answer is no,Mozart.

1361
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:09,840
Please.

1362
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:16,280
Please!

1363
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:55,280
Don't answer it.

1364
02:15:55,600 --> 02:15:58,840
Why?

1365
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:02,080
Tell him...

1366
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:04,720
Tell him I'm not here.

1367
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:07,600
Tell him...

1368
02:16:07,880 --> 02:16:11,160
Tell him I'm working on it.

1369
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:15,080
Come back later.

1370
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:32,640
- Am I interrupting something? - No.

1371
02:16:32,880 --> 02:16:35,680
Good. Where's our friend?

1372
02:16:35,960 --> 02:16:38,200
He's not here.

1373
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:42,600
But he's working on it,he told me to tell you.

1374
02:16:42,840 --> 02:16:46,360
Is that it?

1375
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:54,720
Is he happy with it?

1376
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:59,120
What's this? A Requiem Mass?

1377
02:16:59,400 --> 02:17:03,560
- You think I'm in the funeral business? - Leave that alone!

1378
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:08,320
- Put it down! It's nothing for you! - I'm sorry.

1379
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:11,320
What have you got for me?

1380
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:14,320
Finished?

1381
02:17:14,560 --> 02:17:19,520
- What? - The vaudeville,what do you think?

1382
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:21,440
Yes.

1383
02:17:21,680 --> 02:17:25,080
- Can I see it? - No.

1384
02:17:25,320 --> 02:17:27,040
Why not?

1385
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:31,440
Because there's nothing to see.

1386
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:40,520
Look...

1387
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:47,800
...I asked you if we could start rehearsals next week and you said yes.

1388
02:17:48,040 --> 02:17:52,960
- Well,we can. - So let me see it. Where is it?

1389
02:17:53,240 --> 02:17:55,560
Here.

1390
02:17:55,800 --> 02:18:01,320
It's all right here in my noodle. The rest is just scribbling.

1391
02:18:01,560 --> 02:18:06,840
Scribbling and bibbling. Bibbling and scribbling.

1392
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:10,840
- Like a drink? - Look,you little cunt!

1393
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:13,680
Do you know how many people I've hired?

1394
02:18:13,960 --> 02:18:16,400
- Leave him alone! - I'm paying them!

1395
02:18:16,680 --> 02:18:20,920
- He's doing his best. - Paying them to wait. It's ridiculous!

1396
02:18:21,160 --> 02:18:24,640
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto!

1397
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:28,000
Only an idiot would ask him to work on that!

1398
02:18:28,280 --> 02:18:30,760
Twelve-foot snakes,magic flutes?

1399
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,840
What's so intelligent about a Requiem?

1400
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:38,560
Money. Money.

1401
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:42,120
You're mad.

1402
02:18:42,360 --> 02:18:44,000
She's mad.

1403
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:48,360
- Oh,yes? - Wolfie,write it down.

1404
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:50,480
Just write it down.

1405
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:52,800
On paper.

1406
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:56,160
It's no use to anybody in your head.

1407
02:18:56,400 --> 02:19:00,720
To hell with your death Mass!

1408
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:03,720
Calm yourself. What's the matter with you?

1409
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:08,280
- I won't work there anymore. - What happened?

1410
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:11,520
You don't know what it's like.

1411
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:14,760
"Herr Mozart" frightens me.

1412
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,760
He drinks all day...

1413
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:20,680
...then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.

1414
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:23,960
Is he working?

1415
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:27,280
Oh,I am frightened,sir,really!

1416
02:19:27,520 --> 02:19:33,960
- When he speaks,he makes no sense. - Is he working?

1417
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:36,880
I suppose so.

1418
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:41,760
He sits there all the time,doing some silly opera.

1419
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,120
- Opera? - Don't ask me to go back again.

1420
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:48,600
I'm frightened. I'm very,very frightened!

1421
02:19:48,840 --> 02:19:53,560
Are you sure it's an opera?

1422
02:21:35,560 --> 02:21:38,440
I don't have it yet.

1423
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:42,240
Are you neglecting my request?

1424
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:46,200
No. No,I...

1425
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:48,720
I promise you...

1426
02:21:48,960 --> 02:21:54,520
...I'll give you a wonderful piece,the best I ever...

1427
02:21:56,720 --> 02:22:00,360
This is my wife,Stanzi.

1428
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:04,160
I've been sick,but I'm all right now,aren't I?

1429
02:22:04,440 --> 02:22:06,480
Yes,sir. He's all right.

1430
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:10,840
And he's working on it very hard.

1431
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:14,680
Give me two more weeks. Please.

1432
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:19,240
The sooner you finish,the greater your reward.

1433
02:22:19,480 --> 02:22:23,080
Work.

1434
02:22:30,440 --> 02:22:33,520
Wolfie.

1435
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:38,920
I think you really are going mad.

1436
02:22:38,920 --> 02:22:43,480
You slave for that idiot actor who won't give you a penny!

1437
02:22:43,720 --> 02:22:46,480
And here,this is not a ghost!

1438
02:22:46,720 --> 02:22:52,280
This is a real man,who puts down real money.

1439
02:22:52,720 --> 02:22:56,440
Why on earth won't you finish it?

1440
02:22:56,680 --> 02:23:02,080
Can you give me one reason I can understand?

1441
02:23:02,600 --> 02:23:06,240
It's killing me.

1442
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:10,880
You're drunk,aren't you?

1443
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:15,720
Be honest,tell me. You've been drinking.

1444
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:21,920
It's not fair. I worry about you all the time.

1445
02:23:22,160 --> 02:23:25,520
I do everything I can to help you.

1446
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:30,120
And all you do is drink and talk nonsense,and frighten me.

1447
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:34,400
Go back to bed!

1448
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:44,600
Please.

1449
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:50,240
Let me... Let me sit here.

1450
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:55,360
Let me stay here with you.

1451
02:26:27,400 --> 02:26:30,160
I did it. And I was proud to do it.

1452
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:34,320
"Leave!" I said. "Right away. Take the child with you!"

1453
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:39,040
"Go to the spa and get your health back." I was shocked.

1454
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:42,040
Shocked to my foundation when I saw her.

1455
02:26:42,320 --> 02:26:45,600
I couldn't believe my eyes,poor little thing.

1456
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:49,280
You monster! No one exists but you,do they?

1457
02:26:49,520 --> 02:26:52,160
You and your music. I warned her.

1458
02:26:52,400 --> 02:26:55,160
"Choose a man,not a baby",I said.

1459
02:26:55,440 --> 02:27:00,560
"You marry him,you won't have a pot to piss in." You selfish thing!

1460
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:07,320
Selfish,that's what you are. Simply selfish! Do you hear me?

1461
02:30:48,840 --> 02:30:50,080
Pick him up.

1462
02:30:50,320 --> 02:30:53,600
Pick him up!

1463
02:30:54,040 --> 02:30:56,480
Be careful. Come with me.

1464
02:30:56,720 --> 02:31:00,040
You,follow me.

1465
02:31:26,120 --> 02:31:31,000
- Is it over? - Yes,it's over. It's over.

1466
02:31:31,240 --> 02:31:34,240
Go!

1467
02:32:14,600 --> 02:32:17,080
Go,go. Go.

1468
02:32:17,360 --> 02:32:20,760
Go! Go!

1469
02:32:48,120 --> 02:32:51,600
Where is your wife?

1470
02:32:53,240 --> 02:32:57,240
Where is your wife?

1471
02:32:58,040 --> 02:33:03,360
She's not well either. She went to the spa.

1472
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:06,160
You are so good to me.

1473
02:33:06,440 --> 02:33:09,680
Truly. Thank you.

1474
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:12,240
Please!

1475
02:33:12,480 --> 02:33:16,480
No,I mean to come to my opera.

1476
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:23,280
You. You are the only colleague of mine who came.

1477
02:33:24,680 --> 02:33:27,440
Mozart.

1478
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:31,760
I would never miss anything you had written.

1479
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:35,360
- It's just a vaudeville. - No,no!

1480
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:38,600
It's a sublime piece.

1481
02:33:38,840 --> 02:33:42,520
The grandest "operone"!

1482
02:33:50,120 --> 02:33:52,120
I tell you...

1483
02:33:52,360 --> 02:33:57,840
...you are the greatest composer known to me.

1484
02:34:00,360 --> 02:34:03,200
Do you mean it?

1485
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:09,920
- It's him! - Who?

1486
02:34:10,160 --> 02:34:12,080
The man.

1487
02:34:12,320 --> 02:34:15,680
He's here.

1488
02:34:17,160 --> 02:34:19,160
Tell him to go away.

1489
02:34:19,440 --> 02:34:24,320
Tell him I'm still working on it. Don't let him in.

1490
02:34:24,560 --> 02:34:26,760
No,no. Wait!

1491
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:30,960
Ask him if he would give me some money now.

1492
02:34:31,240 --> 02:34:36,320
Tell him if he would,it will help me to finish it.

1493
02:34:53,680 --> 02:34:57,600
- Salieri? - Yes.

1494
02:34:57,920 --> 02:35:02,400
- Can we come in? - Better not. He's sleeping.

1495
02:35:02,640 --> 02:35:06,520
- He's all right,though? - Yes,he's just exhausted.

1496
02:35:06,760 --> 02:35:09,840
He became dizzy,that's all.

1497
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:14,800
- Well,tell him we came by,won't you? - Of course.

1498
02:35:15,080 --> 02:35:18,840
Give him this. That's his share.

1499
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:21,760
- That should cheer him up. - Indeed!

1500
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:25,400
And now,good night to you all. It was...

1501
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:27,520
...perfection,truly.

1502
02:35:27,800 --> 02:35:30,800
Thank you.

1503
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:43,200
What happened?

1504
02:35:50,080 --> 02:35:53,400
He said to give you this.

1505
02:35:53,640 --> 02:35:57,600
And if you finish by tomorrow night...

1506
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:01,280
...he will pay you another hundred ducats.

1507
02:36:01,520 --> 02:36:03,640
Another...?

1508
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:08,480
That's too soon. Tomorrow night...

1509
02:36:08,680 --> 02:36:12,200
It's impossible.

1510
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:18,600
- Did he say a hundred? - Yes.

1511
02:36:22,680 --> 02:36:26,160
It's too soon.

1512
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:28,800
Can I...?

1513
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:32,640
Could I help you?

1514
02:36:33,680 --> 02:36:37,080
Would you?

1515
02:36:39,280 --> 02:36:42,280
Actually,you could.

1516
02:36:48,360 --> 02:36:51,000
- I want to go. - Where?

1517
02:36:51,240 --> 02:36:54,440
- I want to go back to Vienna. - Now?

1518
02:36:54,680 --> 02:36:57,840
- Yes. - Why?

1519
02:36:58,680 --> 02:37:02,000
I feel wrong.

1520
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:06,040
I feel wrong being here.

1521
02:37:07,400 --> 02:37:10,960
- Where did I stop? - The end of the "Recordare".

1522
02:37:11,240 --> 02:37:14,400
So now "Confutatis"...

1523
02:37:19,720 --> 02:37:22,080
How would you translate that?

1524
02:37:22,320 --> 02:37:26,680
"Consigned to flames of woe."

1525
02:37:27,320 --> 02:37:31,040
- Do you believe in it? - What?

1526
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:36,440
A fire which never dies,burning you forever.

1527
02:37:36,680 --> 02:37:39,480
Oh,yes.

1528
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:42,840
Possible.

1529
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:46,800
- Come,let's begin. - We ended in F major.

1530
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:51,920
- Yes. - So,now,A minor.

1531
02:37:58,160 --> 02:38:02,760
- A minor. - Yes.

1532
02:38:04,080 --> 02:38:08,600
"Confutatis". A minor.

1533
02:38:09,360 --> 02:38:11,240
Start with the voices.

1534
02:38:11,480 --> 02:38:14,760
- Basses first. Second beat of the... - Time?

1535
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:19,680
Common time. Second beat of the first measure.

1536
02:38:19,960 --> 02:38:23,440
On A.

1537
02:38:23,800 --> 02:38:26,560
Second measure,second beat.

1538
02:38:26,800 --> 02:38:28,000
You see?

1539
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:30,000
- Yes. G-sharp? - Of course.

1540
02:38:30,240 --> 02:38:35,080
Second beat of the third measure,on E.

1541
02:38:40,520 --> 02:38:44,400
Do you have me? Show me.

1542
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:05,160
Good. Good.

1543
02:39:05,400 --> 02:39:06,960
Now the tenors.

1544
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:12,000
Fourth beat of the first measure,on C.

1545
02:39:12,560 --> 02:39:17,520
Second measure,fourth beat. D.

1546
02:39:18,280 --> 02:39:20,520
- All right? - Yes,continue.

1547
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:25,560
Second beat of the fourth measure,on F.

1548
02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:34,800
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon,bass trombones,basses.

1549
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:39,120
Identical notes and rhythm.

1550
02:39:40,680 --> 02:39:46,400
First bassoon,tenor trombones,with the tenors.

1551
02:39:49,800 --> 02:39:53,520
- You go too fast. - Do you have it?

1552
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:56,920
- Bassoon to trombone what? - With the tenors.

1553
02:39:57,160 --> 02:40:00,560
- Identical? - The instruments doubling the voices.

1554
02:40:00,800 --> 02:40:04,440
Trumpets and timpani. Trumpets in D. Listen.

1555
02:40:04,680 --> 02:40:07,120
- I don't understand! - Listen!

1556
02:40:07,360 --> 02:40:12,560
Trumpets in D,tonic and dominant,first and third beats.

1557
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:16,360
It goes with the harmony!

1558
02:40:21,280 --> 02:40:25,200
Yes. Yes,yes!

1559
02:40:32,800 --> 02:40:35,120
I understand. And that's all?

1560
02:40:35,400 --> 02:40:38,720
No,now for the real fire. Strings in unison.

1561
02:40:38,960 --> 02:40:43,280
Ostinato,on A. Like this:

1562
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:48,080
Next measure is rising.

1563
02:40:48,360 --> 02:40:52,240
Do you have it? Show me.

1564
02:40:58,320 --> 02:41:02,960
- It's wonderful! - Yes,yes. Go on.

1565
02:41:08,160 --> 02:41:11,680
- Write that down! - Yes,yes.

1566
02:41:14,320 --> 02:41:17,200
"Call me among the blessed."

1567
02:41:17,480 --> 02:41:19,040
C major.

1568
02:41:19,320 --> 02:41:25,520
Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C,sopranos above.

1569
02:41:36,680 --> 02:41:39,440
Sopranos up to F on the second "voca"?

1570
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:45,680
And on "dictus". And underneath,just violins. Arpeggios.

1571
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:49,240
Scale in eighth notes,then back to ostinato.

1572
02:41:49,480 --> 02:41:51,640
- Do you have it? - You go too fast.

1573
02:41:51,880 --> 02:41:56,680
- Do you have it? - One moment,please!

1574
02:41:59,080 --> 02:42:04,480
Good. Show me the whole thing from the beginning.

1575
02:44:06,200 --> 02:44:08,800
Do you want to rest a bit?

1576
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:12,760
No,I'm not tired at all.

1577
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:19,800
We'll stop for a moment.

1578
02:44:20,080 --> 02:44:25,120
- Then we'll finish the "Lacrimosa". - I can keep going. I assure you.

1579
02:44:25,360 --> 02:44:30,160
Will you stay with me while I sleep a little?

1580
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:34,200
I'm not leaving you.

1581
02:44:40,120 --> 02:44:43,520
I'm so ashamed.

1582
02:44:43,760 --> 02:44:46,040
Of what?

1583
02:44:46,320 --> 02:44:48,680
I was foolish.

1584
02:44:48,920 --> 02:44:55,040
I thought you did not care for my work,or me.

1585
02:44:57,160 --> 02:45:00,680
Forgive me.

1586
02:45:03,720 --> 02:45:07,360
Forgive me.

1587
02:46:03,640 --> 02:46:07,640
What are you doing here?

1588
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:12,400
Your husband took sick.

1589
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:16,160
I brought him home.

1590
02:46:16,400 --> 02:46:19,080
Why you?

1591
02:46:19,320 --> 02:46:24,120
Because,madame,I was at hand.

1592
02:46:26,360 --> 02:46:31,200
Well,thank you very much. You can go now.

1593
02:46:32,160 --> 02:46:34,280
He needs me,ma'am.

1594
02:46:34,520 --> 02:46:36,360
No,he doesn't.

1595
02:46:36,600 --> 02:46:41,160
And I don't want you here. Just go,please.

1596
02:46:41,400 --> 02:46:45,920
- He asked me to stay. - And I'm ask...

1597
02:47:14,440 --> 02:47:18,000
I'm back.

1598
02:47:19,640 --> 02:47:24,040
I missed you so much.

1599
02:47:26,240 --> 02:47:29,240
If you'd just...

1600
02:47:29,520 --> 02:47:34,040
...show me that you need me.

1601
02:47:38,440 --> 02:47:43,240
And I'll try to do better too.

1602
02:47:53,440 --> 02:47:56,800
What is this?

1603
02:47:58,440 --> 02:48:04,360
No,Wolfie,not this. Not this.

1604
02:48:06,520 --> 02:48:11,080
You're not to work on this ever again.

1605
02:48:11,320 --> 02:48:14,720
I've decided.

1606
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:21,160
This is not his handwriting.

1607
02:48:21,400 --> 02:48:23,920
It's mine.

1608
02:48:24,160 --> 02:48:27,240
I was assisting him.

1609
02:48:27,480 --> 02:48:30,560
He's not to work on this anymore.

1610
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:34,560
- It's making him ill. - But...

1611
02:48:35,840 --> 02:48:39,520
Good night.

1612
02:48:40,480 --> 02:48:45,040
I regret we have no servants to show you out,"Herr Salieri".

1613
02:48:45,280 --> 02:48:48,200
Please respect my wish and go.

1614
02:48:48,440 --> 02:48:50,200
Madame...

1615
02:48:50,480 --> 02:48:54,560
...I will respect his.

1616
02:52:57,440 --> 02:53:01,840
Your merciful God.

1617
02:53:03,600 --> 02:53:08,840
He destroyed his own beloved,rather than let a mediocrity...

1618
02:53:09,080 --> 02:53:14,280
...share in the smallest part of his glory.

1619
02:53:14,520 --> 02:53:16,880
He killed Mozart.

1620
02:53:17,160 --> 02:53:19,840
And kept me alive to torture.

1621
02:53:20,120 --> 02:53:22,240
Thirty-two years of torture.

1622
02:53:22,480 --> 02:53:28,120
Thirty-two years of slowly watching myself become extinct.

1623
02:53:28,360 --> 02:53:30,560
My music...

1624
02:53:30,840 --> 02:53:32,680
...growing fainter.

1625
02:53:32,960 --> 02:53:35,760
All the time fainter...

1626
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:39,640
...till no one plays it at all.

1627
02:53:39,880 --> 02:53:42,680
And his...

1628
02:53:43,040 --> 02:53:47,760
Good morning,professor. Time for the water closet.

1629
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:53,280
Then we have your favorite breakfast. Sugar rolls. He loves those.

1630
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:56,160
Fresh sugar rolls.

1631
02:53:56,400 --> 02:53:58,840
I will speak for you,Father.

1632
02:53:59,120 --> 02:54:02,480
I speak for all mediocrities in the world.

1633
02:54:02,720 --> 02:54:05,440
I am their champion.

1634
02:54:05,680 --> 02:54:09,960
I am their patron saint.

1635

Mediocrities everywhere...

1636
02:54:23,120 --> 02:54:27,160
...I absolve you.

I absolve you.

1638
02:54:30,320 --> 02:54:34,280
I absolve you.

1639
02:54:35,080 --> 02:54:38,160
I absolve you.

1640
02:54:38,440 --> 02:54:43,000
I absolve you all.
